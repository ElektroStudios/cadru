          <p>
            Although Cadru was released as open source in 2013, 
            some of the APIs it contains have over 10 years of real world use
            behind them.

            <h2 class="boxed-content-title">Portable.</h2>
            <p>
              Cadru is designed to be portable first, which means that the majority
              of the library is available as a Portable Class Library (PCL) targeting
              the broadest set of platforms possible.
              Any platform specific functionality is exposed as more narrowly focused
              portable class libraries or as a non portable library if thatâ€™s the
              only option.

          <h2 class="boxed-content-title">API.</h2>
          <p>
            Although Cadru grew from app development, it's been written with a focus on being 
            part of an API. That means everything is (hopefully) well documented, cleanly
            written, and easy to use.

    <p class="lead">Unlike other libraries, Cadru is made up several focused libraries.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cadru.Core</strong> &mdash;
        A portable class library which provides the majority of the framework.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cadru.Core.Windows</strong> &mdash;
        A non-portable class library (targeting .NET Framework 4) meant for Windows desktop applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cadru.Data.Dapper</strong> &mdash;
        A non-portable class library (targeting .NET Framework 4) providing a database context and other
        uitlities for working with databases using the Dapper micro-ORM.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cadru.UnitTest.Framework</strong> &mdash;
        A non-portable class library (targeting .NET Framework 4) which adds additional assert capabilities for MSTest.</li>
    </ul>
